# Cars and Money
The aim of this repository is to showcase my ability to build and instantiate both classes and functions.

## Vehicle.py

In the vehicle.py file, you'll find various classes which outline a specific style of vehicle. The functions allow the classes to be parsed through upon user input via python REPL. 

## Wallet.py

In the wallet.py file, you'll find classes that comprise a "wallet" or running total of a given starting amount of money, while the functions allow for the input of expenditure via python REPL. Depending on the running total, a message is returned conveying whether or not the funds are avaliable.
